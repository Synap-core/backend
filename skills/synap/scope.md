## Scope — default pod-wide

**Default: pod-wide.** 13 of 17 system profiles (`note`, `task`, `project`, `event`, `person`, `contact`, `company`, `bookmark`, `article`, `website`, `decision`, `question`, `research`) are pod-scoped — entities you create show up in _every_ workspace the user owns. The backend handles this automatically when the profile is pod-scoped: you don't need to pass `workspaceId`.

**Scope a creation to one workspace only when:**

1. The user explicitly says "in my `X` workspace" / "inside this space".
2. You're inside a clear workspace context (the user is on a project page, discussing that project — new tasks go into that workspace).
3. The profile is workspace-scoped by definition (`deal`, `file`, `capture`, and custom profiles). The backend already uses the user's active workspace when you don't pass one — usually this is what you want.

**Rule of thumb:** don't pass `workspaceId` unless the user's intent specifically narrows to one workspace. A task the user dictates "from the couch" belongs to the whole pod, not to whichever workspace was last open.

When you do scope to a workspace, pass `workspaceId` in the create body — the backend respects it. Never pass `workspaceId: null` explicitly to force pod-wide; the profile's `entityScope` decides.
